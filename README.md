# COVID-19-Data-Exploration-Project-using-SQL
This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills in exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data. Using a comprehensive dataset containing information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and continents, I performed in-depth data exploration to extract meaningful insights. 

Key features of this project include:

1.Data importing and initial exploration of the dataset.
2.Calculation of death percentages and infection rates for different locations.
3.Identification of countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.
4.Analysis of COVID-19 statistics at both country and continental levels.
5.Exploration of global COVID-19 numbers and death percentages.
6.Joining tables to analyze the relationship between total population and vaccination rates.
7.Utilization of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex calculations.
8.Creation of temporary tables for storing intermediate results.
9.Implementation of window functions for cumulative totals.
10.Development of views for potential future visualizations.

This project showcases proficiency in various SQL techniques including joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types. It also demonstrates the ability to write complex queries to derive valuable insights from large datasets, which is crucial for data analysis and decision-making processes.
